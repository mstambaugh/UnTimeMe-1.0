_unTimeMe is a unique productivity timer application built in React Native. It is a completely non-linguistic, atemporal aid developed for individuals who struggle to begin large or intimidating projects, with a more specific intended audience of neurodivergent or atypical individuals whose negative experiences in educational or professional environments often lead to guilt, anxiety, and decreased self-esteem, even when they excel in those environments. Although this feeling of precarity is likely to consequentially decrease productivity, increased productivity is a secondary goal to the unTimeMe user experience. Most productivity timer apps on the market The application instead aims to create a low-stakes, validating user experience which could benefit a user's attitude towards themselves and their capacity to complete tasks by minimizing pressure, rather than intensifying it as most standard productivity timer apps are apt to intensify._
 
_The application collects an inputted emoji from the user when they are ready to begin a task and indicating their present emotional state/feelings about beginning the task. It will then assign and start a semi-randomized hidden timer given the user’s emoji input (with ranges from very short to mid-length based upon the emotional “state” connoted). The app will allow users to view a graphic representation of their total work-time, and their time working in each emoji “state”, across use, along with a visual representation of the trajectory of their emoji state from start to finish._
